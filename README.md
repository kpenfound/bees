# A Bee AI Simulation

## Concepts

### World

The world is a generated space containing bee hives, bees, and flowers

### Bees

Bees are intended to travel from hive to flowers and back.  Their goal
is to collect nectar from the flowers and bring it to the hive.  In visiting
a flower, the flower will become pollinated.  A bee can only be away from it's
hive for so long.
  
### Hive

A hive is the homebase for a bee and collects nectar.  The hive can convert
nectar into new bees.

### Flowers

Flowers contain nectar for the bees to collect and need to be pollinated.  Once
pollinated, a flower can create a new flower.
